# DRC Simulator

I forked this from https://bitbucket.org/memahaxx/drc-sim, all credit to the
original authors.

So far I've added nothing but this README.

## Goals

keyboard and mouse control for Wii U. Support mouse for "touch" input on the
gamepad screen as well while in CAPSLOCK or something.

## Expected Prodedure:

1. get an rt2800usb with 5ghz support.
1. follow steps described in [this blog post][1] to pair your box with a Wii U.
1. install requirements for drc-sim.py
1. run drc-sim.py and enjoy flailing around trying to get the Wii U to do something.

## Inspiration

My research starting point was [this Reddit post][2]
